# NOTE

I mistakenly set the remote origin to the official Laravel repository (laravel/laravel), which caused my project to pull directly from that source. As a result, the contributor list now includes the original Laravel maintainers. This has since been resolved, and it does not affect the functionality or integrity of my project.

Additionally, I attempted to integrate Docker with the Angular frontend. However, I encountered issues connecting Nginx to serve the actual Angular application. While the container builds successfully, the application does not render as expected.

This experience has sparked my curiosity about Docker and its potential. I plan to study containerization more deeply to enhance future deployments and improve my understanding of scalable software architecture. 

Lastly, I used Ai-assistance since this is my first time using AngularJs even with the greater learning curve, I am able to create a proper frontend integrated by latest laravel and angular.

On how this works, 

1. Open Xampp for myphpadmin

2. type in the directory root "php artisan serve"
